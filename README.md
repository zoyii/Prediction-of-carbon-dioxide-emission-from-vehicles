# Prediction-of-carbon-dioxide-emission-from-vehicles
Due to increase in the population, the public and personal transport increased on the roads, that contribute to the increase in carbon in the atmosphere thus deteriorating the air quality. The air polluted with carbon dioxide has harmful effects on human health. It cause serious health problems like inflammation, kidney and bone problems, inflammation and reduced cognitive performance. High levels of CO2  replaces the oxygen carried by hemoglobin, this results in lower levels of oxygen that mostly cause headaches, dizziness, restlessness, tingling feeling, difficulty in breathing, sweating, tiredness, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, coma, asphyxia, and convulsions.  So, by using machine learning model for the prediction the rate of carbon emission, we can manage the air pollution and the public health conditions affected by the high levels of carbon dioxide in the air.
